# A biobjective approach for finding majority-minority districts

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act enacts creating majority-minority districts to provide minority groups with opportunities to elect representatives of their choice. However, a majority-minority district is created if at least the following conditions (â€œGingles prongs'') are satisfied: (i) compactness and numerosity (say more than 50% of the citizen voting-age population), (ii) political cohesion, and (iii) sufficiency of white majority vote to defeat the preferred candidate of minorities.  Furthermore, if the first condition is not satisfied, then there is no requirement on creating a majority-minority district. Although the second and third Gingles prongs are qualitative measures, the first prong can be captured by mathematical models and algorithms.

Gingle prongs are not the only criteria that should be respected. There are three more basic rules that must be considered in districting plans.
